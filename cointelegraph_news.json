    "內容": "Bitcoin mining firm BIT Mining has admitted it authorized paying bribes to Japanese politicians in an attempt to win a bid for a resort and casino license in Japan and has agreed to pay $10 million worth of fines to the United States government to resolve the charges. \nBIT Mining’s bribery scheme occurred between 2017 and 2019 when the firm was known as 500.com — a Chinese online sports lottery company. \nThe bribes consisted of roughly $2.5 million worth of illicit cash bribes, entertainment and extravagant trips for Japanese politicians, according to the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s Nov. 18 statement.\nBIT Mining agreed to pay a $4 million civil penalty to the SEC and a $10 million criminal fine to the US Department of Justice (DOJ). However, $4 million of that will be satisfied by the civil penalty paid to the SEC.\nMeanwhile, the DOJ has also charged 500.com’s then-CEO Zhengming Pan for orchestrating the bribes. \nThe DOJ said he entered into “sham contracts” with third-party consultants to make the illicit payments and falsely recorded those payments as legitimate business expenses to conceal the bribes.\nSource: Department of Justice\nAdvertisement\nExperience the magic of WAGMI Miami on Jan. 21-24 – The Biggest Blockchain Event in America – Get your tickets now!\nAd\nThe contract would have allowed the company to open a resort, including hotels, casinos, retail, dining, convention facilities and entertainment venues in Japan. However, the company ultimately failed to win the contract to open the resort. \nRelated: SEC sues ‘fake’ crypto exchanges in first action on pig butchering scams\n“Paying bribes to foreign government officials is a serious crime,” US Attorney Philip Sellinger for the District of New Jersey said.\nOne of the SEC’s Enforcement Division chiefs, Charles E.

    "內容": "Bitcoin\nBTC\n$91,644\nhas been trading within a narrow 7% range since Nov. 12, signaling a period of consolidation around $91,000. Still, derivatives indicate that professional traders remain confident in the bull market. Additionally, multiple attempts to break above the $92,000 level suggest strong buying demand beyond MicroStrategy’s multiple BTC acquisitions.\nBitcoin 30-day options 25% skew (put-call) at Deribit. Source: Laevitas\nThe BTC options delta skew has dropped to its lowest level in four months, indicating the market is pricing a discount for put (sell) options. Levels below -6% suggest bullish sentiment and reflect confidence in the $87,000 support level, particularly from whales and arbitrage desks.\nWhile such data suggests optimism, it does not guarantee that investors are confident the bull market will continue. It is crucial to analyze the factors driving recent momentum. For example, if analysts view MicroStrategy as the primary catalyst for Bitcoin’s surge to a new all-time high, signs should be visible in BTC futures and margin markets.\nIs MicroStrategy the sole driver behind Bitcoin’s bull run?\nThe speculation that a few entities are responsible for the buying activity above $87,000 gained traction after MicroStrategy revealed an additional purchase of 51,780 BTC on Nov. 18. According to an SEC filing, the company now holds over $29 billion in Bitcoin and is actively pursuing a plan to raise $21 billion through the issuance and sale of company shares.\nAdvertisement\nExperience the magic of WAGMI Miami on Jan. 21-24 – The Biggest Blockchain Event in America – Get your tickets now!\nAd\nBy contrast, investors believe that Bitcoin has a greater chance of continued price appreciation if spot BTC exchange-traded fund (ETF) net inflows show signs of early adoption, including increased exposure from pension funds and large hedge fund managers. However, the latest data from Nov. 14 and 15 revealed $771 million in net ETF outflows as investors decided to take profits following the recent rally.\nTo understand how professional traders are positioned, it’s essential to analyze Bitcoin futures and margin markets. For example, sustained demand for leveraged BTC futures indicates bullish sentiment, while increased use of price hedging suggests whales and arbitrage desks lack confidence in the current price momentum.\nBitcoin 2-month futures annualized premium. Source: Laevitas\nThe Bitcoin two-month futures premium (basis rate) surged to 17% on Nov. 18, far exceeding the 5%–10% neutral threshold. This level of optimism was last observed almost eight months ago, in late March, when Bitcoin successfully defended the $64,000 level after two weeks of downward pressure.\nTo further assess traders’ sentiment, it’s essential to analyze BTC margin markets. Unlike derivatives contracts, which always require a buyer and a seller, margin markets allow traders to borrow stablecoins to buy spot Bitcoin. Similarly, bearish traders can borrow BTC to create short positions, betting on a price decline.\nRelated: ‘I put most of my wealth into Bitcoin, so I am fully committed’ — RFK Jr.\nBitcoin margin long-to-short ratio at OKX. Source: OKX\nCurrently, the Bitcoin long-to-short margin ratio at OKX is 14 times in favor of longs (buyers). Historically, periods of excessive confidence have driven the indicator above 40 times, while levels below 5 times favoring longs are generally considered bearish.\nUltimately, Bitcoin derivatives and margin markets signal strong bullish momentum, regardless of the concentration of buy-side activity driven by MicroStrategy. The lack of a significant impact from the retest of the $88,700 level on Nov. 17 further suggests that investors are not ready to exit at the first negative price swing.\nExplore more articles like this\nSubscribe to the Markets Outlook newsletter\nGet critical insights to spot investment opportunities, mitigate risks, and refine your trading strategies.

Since reaching an all-time high (ATH) at $93,450, its value has oscillated between the ATH and $87,000.\nDuring that consolidation period, SuperBitcoinBro, an anonymous technical analyst, indicated that BTC had formed a bullish pennant on the daily chart.\nA bullish pennant is a continuation pattern that occurs after a significant rise, followed by a consolidation period at the higher price end of the range.\nBitcoin daily chart analysis.

CryptoQuant’s quick take insight also implied a similar sentiment and mentioned:\n“It seems like Coinbase is taking a breath to decide its next move. It would be wise for conservative traders to enter after the Coinbase Premium regains its momentum.”\nThis aligns with the fact that Bitcoin transaction volume under $100,000 reached a new three-year high. Ki-Young Ju, CryptoQuant’s CEO, believed that retail FOMO under the $100,000 limit might lead to the formation of “exit liquidity” for the whales.

    "標題": "Why US spot Bitcoin options launch is such a big deal",
    "內容": "The imminent launch of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund options in the United States may be a huge deal because extra liquidity should entice a new wave of institutional and retail investors, according to industry executive Joe Consorti.\n“The floodgates for Bitcoin’s next evolution in financial markets are about to open,” as the first spot Bitcoin\nBTC\n$91,685\nETF options are set to start trading in the United States on Nov. 19, said Consorti, head of growth at Bitcoin custody firm Theya, in a video shared on X on Nov. 19.\nOn Nov. 18, the Options Clearing Corporation (OCC) said it was preparing to launch the investment vehicles, beginning with the BlackRock iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT). \n“The launch of spot Bitcoin ETF options, specifically for the IBIT vehicle, marks the beginning of a new era for price dynamics, volatility and institutional adoption,” Consorti said. \nThe head of ETP listings at Nasdaq, Alison Hennessy, said the exchange intended to list and trade spot BTC ETF options as early as Nov. 19.\nSpot Bitcoin ETF options are financial derivatives that give investors the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell shares of spot crypto ETFs at predetermined prices. \nBloomberg’s senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas said that this was a “BFD,” sharing Consorti’s video on X on Nov. 19. \nAdvertisement\nSave up to $1,000 on swaps, buy crypto with 50% off fees, and share a $5,000 prize pool—join Changelly Black Friday! \nAd\nConsorti said that options are the foundations of capital markets as they provide liquidity, price discovery and risk management tools, particularly for institutional investors that “drive a lot of the core of the market.” \nHe added: “This matters hugely because, in traditional markets, derivatives are 10 to 20 times the size of the underlying market cap,” but with Bitcoin, listed derivatives are less than 1% of the $1.8 trillion spot market cap.\nBitcoin derivatives are “vastly underdeveloped,” and this limits the market’s maturity because there is a “huge institutional demand” for these products from hedging and allocation perspectives, he said. \nConsorti said that most Bitcoin derivatives are traded offshore or OTC (over-the-counter) on venues such as Deribit, which currently has $31 billion in open interest, while US investors are locked out. \nThe US equity markets are the largest and most liquid in the world, comprising 44% of the $109 trillion global equity market, he said, before adding:\n“Listing options on Bitcoin ETFs brings BTC into the largest capital market in the world, and unlocks unprecedented opportunities because of this, namely liquidity in depth.” \nPreviously excluded retail investors can now join the Bitcoin derivatives market, “significantly expanding the investor base,” he said. \nRelated: Bitcoin ETF options pass ‘second hurdle’ with CFTC clearance\nConsorti said that as derivatives markets grow, BTC will follow the path of equities and commodities, where derivatives are many times the size of the spot market. This may unleash trillions of dollars in potential trading volume, he said. \n“Listing options on ETFs opens the doors to the largest and deepest liquidity pools on the planet,” and major market makers, institutional capital, and retail investors can now all “participate at scale.” \nIn October, trading firm QCP Capital said Bitcoin ETF liquidity would surge after the SEC approved options trading on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE).\nMagazine: Legal issues surround the FBI’s creation of fake crypto tokens\nExplore more articles like this\nSubscribe to the Markets Outlook newsletter\nGet critical insights to spot investment opportunities, mitigate risks, and refine your trading strategies.

    "內容": "The upcoming Cardano-Bitcoin bridge, based on the Grail protocol, may be a first step toward providing decentralized finance (DeFi) applications that are secured by Bitcoin, documents from the bridge’s underlying protocol reveal.\nOn Oct. 24, Emurgo, the development team backing Cardano, announced that it was developing the bridge in partnership with Grail’s developer, BTCOS.\nIn an X post on the following day, Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson clarified that the network will eventually host DeFi applications secured by Bitcoin, adding that, “With babel fees, Bitcoin developers can develop Hybrid Cardano/Bitcoin applications in Aiken and pay their transaction fees in bitcoin.”\nThe post was deleted on Nov. 16, but similar statements from Hoskinson were recorded by X user Al’O and shared through his channel.\nSome Bitcoin users were skeptical of the idea that DeFi apps could be secured by the Bitcoin network.\nCritics claimed that earlier “Bitcoin layer 2s” didn’t allow users to withdraw their Bitcoin without the consent of the network’s operator and suspected that the new Cardano/Bitcoin hybrid network would be more of the same.\nStill, documents for Grail show that it does allow Bitcoin users to withdraw from Cardano without the consent of its validators.\nSmart contracts on Bitcoin\nGrail was inspired by an earlier idea called “BitVM,” described by developer Robin Linus in a 2023 white paper.\nThe paper proposed that a Bitcoin “optimistic rollup,” similar to Ethereum’s Optimism, Base or Arbitrum, could be created by having a server that commits to either a “0” or “1” for each bit of data stored. It said that simple games like chess, go or poker could be run on Bitcoin using this system.\nAn example of a BitVM logic circuit on Bitcoin, used to create smart contracts. Source: BitVM white paper.\nAdvertisement\nSave up to $1,000 on swaps, buy crypto with 50% off fees, and share a $5,000 prize pool—join Changelly Black Friday! \nAd\nThe Grail white paper, published in April, said that Grail “builds on the BitVM paradigm,” and the original BitVM system created billions of complex transactions that would ultimately make its bridge impractical to use.\nTo reduce the complexity, Grail uses zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs to shrink the amount of data that needs to be stored on Bitcoin. \nThe end result is a system that allows users to deposit Bitcoin into the layer-2 network without needing to trust that network’s security. In this case, it means that users could withdraw their Bitcoin\nBTC\n$91,683\nfrom Cardano even if Cardano’s nodes were taken over by a malicious actor.\nCreating hybrid apps may take a long time\nEven after the bridge is implemented, developing DeFi apps secured by Bitcoin may take a while. In his now-deleted X post, Hoskinson said developers would need to be trained in Cardano’s Aiken programming language to create these hybrid Bitcoin/Cardano apps.\nSince most Ethereum DeFi developers are trained in Solidity, this implies that new apps can’t be created by just cutting and pasting ones from Ethereum. They’ll have to be written from scratch.\nAiken programming language documentation. Source: Aiken.\nIn the recording posted by Al’O, Hoskinson said, “It’s going to be an enormous amount of work, it’s a very heavy lift, and there’s going to be wallet integrations and all of these things that have to happen.” He went on to say that the work was worth it because “there’s $1.5 trillion in the Bitcoin space.”\nWithdrawals can still be blocked\nCointelegraph spoke to Edan Yago, co-founder of Grail developer BTC OS. Yago said that withdrawals from the bridge could still be blocked if 100% of its verifiers collude maliciously.\n“In order to take over the Grail system maliciously, you would need to own 100% of the nodes,” he said.\nStill, he said, this is “a stronger security assumption than Bitcoin,” since Bitcoin only relies only on the assumption that the “majority of miners [or hash power]” are honest.\nIn Yago’s view, the bridge has better security than current Bitcoin pegging systems, and creating a more secure system is necessary because trillions of dollars worth of capital is tied up in Bitcoin. He added:\n“Most BTC is latent today because holders don’t want to trust third-party centralized entities that provide bridging/wrapping to other blockchains. We believe that a vault or a bridge like Grail — secured by zero-knowledge cryptography and a network of Bitcoin miners — could be the safest crypto native vault solution that holders will more readily rely on before putting their BTC to work.”\nOP_CAT as an alternative for Bitcoin DeFi\nGrail is not the only solution that attempts to secure DeFi apps using the Bitcoin network. Another option, called “OP_CAT” also claims to provide this benefit. Still, it would require a soft fork of the Bitcoin node software, which some Bitcoin nodes are reluctant to do.\nEven so, StarkWare CEO Eli Ben Sasson has advocated for the change and predicted that it will go live “within the next 12 months.”\nRelated: OP_CAT could go live on Bitcoin within 12 months: Eli Ben Sasson\nWhen asked about OP_CAT, Yago said that its implementation “does not materially change the security assumptions of the bridge.” \nHe doesn’t support adding OP_CAT to Bitcoin, since he believes that it is “quite risky.” He said:\n“OP_CAT can quickly become very cumbersome in terms of transaction size, and even chains like Fractal that have created a Bitcoin fork with OP_CAT activated are finding that it brings its own complexities to solve.”\nEven so, he said that if OP_CAT were implemented, it “might change the architecture of how one can do zk verification on Bitcoin, but it [wouldn’t] materially change how the bridge would work.”\nExplore more articles like this\nSubscribe to the Finance Redefined newsletter\nA weekly toolkit that breaks down the latest DeFi developments, offers sharp analysis, and uncovers new financial opportunities to help you make smart decisions with confidence.

    "標題": "Bitcoin mining to make a comeback in households — Interview with Canaan",
    "內容": "Bitcoin\nBTC\n$91,721\nmining went through a dramatic transformation over the years thanks to the skyrocketing popularity of cryptocurrencies. Despite the scaling up, ASIC devices — short for application-specific integrated circuits — are still the name of the game when it comes to efficiency, speed and energy in BTC mining.\nDesigned solely for Bitcoin’s SHA-256 hashing algorithm, ASIC miners can perform hash calculations at a much higher efficiency than general-purpose processors, contributing to mining success. The commercial availability of ASIC devices dates back to 2013, and the Chinese Bitcoin pioneer, Nangeng ‘NG’ Zhang, is often credited with releasing the first functioning Bitcoin ASIC miner that reached the public.\nNG Zhang and his company, Canaan Inc., have established a strong presence in the Bitcoin mining ecosystem, including a listing on the Nasdaq Global Market. In this interview, NG Zhang shares key insights on the dynamics of the Bitcoin mining industry and introduces Canaan’s upcoming home-friendly miners.\nCointelegraph: It’s been a decade since you designed the first blockchain mining-specific hardware known as ASICs. How do you see the evolution of the digital asset mining space over the past 10 years?\nNangeng Zhang: Over the past decade, the digital asset mining space has evolved across multiple dimensions.\nFirst, hardware performance has seen significant improvements. The first-generation Avalon miner had a hashrate of 66 Ghs with a power consumption of 700W. The 15th-generation A1566 now exceeds 200,000 Ghs with a power consumption of about 3600W. Performance has improved by approximately 3,000 times, and energy efficiency has improved by nearly 600 times.\nSecond, the ecosystem has developed dramatically, from nothing to something significant. In 2013, we were merely a community of thousands of enthusiasts; by 2015, it had gradually become an industry. Today it has grown into a force that cannot be ignored in the global monetary system.\nOur customer base has also expanded from a handful of tech enthusiasts to individual investors, institutional investors and now to Wall Street and publicly listed companies. Looking back on the changes over the past ten years always fills me with excitement. Moreover, all of this was accomplished without a centralized leader — the real credit belongs to everyone.\nCT: How did you come up with the idea of dedicated Bitcoin mining hardware? What inspired you to create the original Avalon series?\nNGZ: Bitcoin’s algorithm is very suitable for hardware implementation, and I believe the move toward ASICs was one of Satoshi Nakamoto’s original intentions. The practice of ASIC-based Bitcoin mining has proven to bring great security to the ecosystem, allowing it to run stably for over ten years.\nLooking back to late 2012, I analyzed the situation at that time: If Bitcoin mining could not quickly transition to being dominated by ASICs, then organizations with the majority of general-purpose computing power might attack the Bitcoin blockchain, leading to the failure of this social experiment. Fortunately, I successfully completed this transition in four and a half months.\nCT: What are the most striking differences between 2013 and 2024 regarding the mining industry and the crypto space overall?\nNGZ: The most significant change is the increase in scale. Today, the mining industry requires large-scale investments, with ongoing growth in facility size, company structure and investment levels.\nAdvertisement\nExperience the magic of WAGMI Miami on Jan. 21-24 – The Biggest Blockchain Event in America – Get your tickets now!\nAd\nI have a neutral view of this change — while the scale has grown, decentralization in the form of many centers is still a type of decentralization, and there has been no serious monopolization. At the same time, we are working to promote the development of the mining industry through approaches that align with business logic and environmental, social and governance (ESG) standards, such as our home heater product line and energy-friendly software and system designs.\nCT: Can you discuss the shifting dynamics between institutional mining and home mining and what factors are driving these changes?\nNGZ: The barriers to entry in mining are continuously rising, and if the only goal is profitability, home mining finds it challenging to compete with institutional mining. Therefore, our promotion of home mining is not about simply redesigning machines meant for institutional use but rather designing entirely new products to meet home needs.\nEase of use, fun and practicality are key. From USB hand warmer miners with 140W power (which can be placed in front of the keyboard to warm your hands), to 800W space heaters and water heaters that can heat villas and provide hot water. Previously, these devices only converted electricity into heat, but now they can also contribute to the security of the blockchain by outputting hashrate.\nCT: What strategies has Canaan implemented to maintain its edge in ASIC high-performance computing and Bitcoin mining technology?\nNGZ: Staying ahead in ASIC high-performance computing and Bitcoin mining technology requires substantial research and development investment while also meeting customer needs. We have consistently used the most advanced process technology to design our chips. In terms of full machines, although we are now on our 15th generation of products, innovation and improvements are happening every day.\nMore importantly, we also focus on business model innovation. For example, some customers need hashrate but lack experience in building and operating facilities. Therefore, we have expanded from offering mining machines to providing system solutions and even building and operating facilities on behalf of customers, directly selling hashrate to them. These business model innovations are crucial for maintaining our competitive edge.\nCT: You have recently launched a new miner, Avalon Bitcoin Miner A1566. What are the key features of this product?\nNGZ: The Avalon Bitcoin Miner A1566 is our latest generation product. Although it has been on the market for some time, its performance continues to improve. Initially, it had a hashrate of 185 THs, but now the delivered models have increased to around 210 THs, and the energy efficiency has improved from 18 J/TH, with some high-end models achieving below 17 J/TH.\nThe A15 series also has excellent heat resistance and is very durable. We have delivered several batches, and the feedback from our customers has been very positive. Additionally, given the diverse market demand, we have launched both water-cooled and oil-cooled versions.\nCT: Could you introduce us to Canaan’s upcoming home miner and heater? What inspired this product, and how do you envision it impacting the home mining market?\nNGZ: Our Avalon Nano3 series has been highly successful, with over 10,000 units shipped last quarter. By the end of this year, we will be launching the Mini series, which can provide room heating with a maximum power of about 800W and is built using our latest chips, with a maximum hashrate of 40T.\nThis is not only environmentally friendly but also meaningful — rather than merely converting electricity into heat, the device also incorporates mining functionality, contributing to the decentralized ecosystem while providing returns. In fact, we had similar products a few years ago, and they received good feedback, but due to limited resources and an immature market at the time, we couldn’t continue their development.\nNow, with current technology and design levels, we are reintroducing this series, and it’s incomparable to what it was before. I hope that, in the future, home mining products can account for 20% of the overall mining market, which will greatly enhance the security of the Bitcoin network.\nCT: Looking ahead, how does Canaan plan to adapt to future industry trends, and what role do you see the company playing in shaping the future of Bitcoin mining?\nNGZ: In the future, the mining industry will continue to evolve. As artificial intelligence develops into AGI (artificial general intelligence) and ASI (artificial super intelligence), for a future Earth that has evolved into a carbon-silicon hybrid civilization, blockchain-based digital currencies are likely to become the universal currency and settlement system for the planet and even the solar system.\nBy that time, the computational demands of artificial intelligence and the mining requirements of the blockchain will merge to create a more complete ecosystem. I believe that our efforts today will serve as a ladder toward the advancement of civilization.\nFind out more about Canaan\n#Bitcoin\n#Blockchain\n#Mining\n#Bitcoin Mining\n#ASIC\n#Avalon\n#Canaan\nDisclaimer.

The sharp rally of the past few days has not deterred the long-term bulls from buying more Bitcoin. MicroStrategy announced on Nov. 18 that it had acquired 51,780 Bitcoin for roughly $4.6 billion at an average price of $88,627. That takes MicroStrategy’s total haul of Bitcoin holdings to 331,200 Bitcoin.\nPaul Tudor Jones is another famed investor who has increased exposure to Bitcoin.

ARK Invest’s Cathie Wood said in an interview with CNBC that Bitcoin has “a long way to go.” Wood believes that a “regulatory relief” from the new United States administration would keep the momentum intact.\nWhat are the important resistance levels in Bitcoin and altcoins that need to be crossed for the uptrend to continue? Let’s analyze the charts to find out.\nS&P 500 Index price analysis\nThe S&P 500 Index (SPX) witnessed profit booking last week, pulling the price down to the 20-day exponential moving average (5,877).\nSPX daily chart. Source: TradingView\nBulls usually buy the dips to the 20-day EMA in a strong uptrend. If the price rebounds off the 20-day EMA with strength, it will improve the prospects of the continuation of the up move. A break and close above 6,017 could open the doors for a rally to 6,221 and eventually to 6,500.\nContrarily, if the 20-day EMA gives way, the index could descend to the 50-day simple moving average (5,780). A break and close below the 50-day SMA could tilt the short-term advantage in favor of the bears.\nUS Dollar Index price analysis\nThe US Dollar Index (DXY) continued its scintillating run last week, indicating solid demand from the bulls.\nDXY daily chart. Source: TradingView\nThe up move is expected to face solid selling in the 107 to 108 resistance zone. If the price continues lower and breaks below 106, it will signal booking profits by the bulls. The index could then decline to the 20-day EMA (105). Buyers will have to defend the 20-day EMA if they want to keep the bullish momentum intact.\nOn the upside, if buyers pierce the overhead resistance zone, it will signal the start of a new uptrend. The index could surge to 114 and then to the pattern target of 116.50. \nBitcoin price analysis\nBitcoin bulls are trying to resume the uptrend but are facing stiff resistance from the bears in the $92,000 to $93,265 zone.\nBTC/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\nThe first support on the downside is the uptrend line. If this support is violated, the BTC/USDT pair could slump to $85,000. Buyers are expected to aggressively protect the $85,000 level because a break below it may sink the pair to the 20-day EMA ($81,772). The deeper the pullback, the longer the time it is likely to take for the next leg of the uptrend to begin.\nAdvertisement\nSave up to $1,000 on swaps, buy crypto with 50% off fees, and share a $5,000 prize pool—join Changelly Black Friday! \nAd\nIf the price continues higher and breaks above $93,265, it will signal that the bullish momentum remains intact. The pair may travel to $100,000 and thereafter to $113,331.\nEther price analysis\nEther\nETH\n$3,121.49\nis taking support at the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level of $3,028, which is a positive sign.\nETH/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\nThe upsloping 20-day EMA ($2,953) and the RSI in the positive territory indicate advantage to buyers. If the bulls propel the price above $3,220, the ETH/USDT pair could retest the downtrend line. This level is expected to behave as a stiff resistance, but if the bulls overcome it, the pair may rise to $3,900.\nConversely, if the price turns down and breaks below the 20-day EMA, it will signal that the bulls are losing their grip. The pair may drop to $2,850 and then to the 50-day SMA ($2,664).\nSolana price analysis\nSolana\nSOL\n$243.31\nsuccessfully held the retest of the breakout level of $210, indicating that the bulls have flipped the level into support.\nSOL/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\nThe SOL/USDT pair started a new uptrend after breaking above $225 on Nov. 17. The pair could rally to $260, which may pose a substantial challenge to the bulls. However, if the buyers bulldoze their way through, the pair could skyrocket to $304.\nTime is running out for the bears. If they want to prevent the up move, they will have to swiftly pull the price back below $210. Such a move will indicate that the markets have rejected the breakout. The pair may tumble to the 50-day SMA ($171).\nBNB price analysis\nBuyers pushed the price above the $635 resistance on Nov. 17, but the bears held their ground. A minor positive is that the bulls have not allowed BNB\nBNB\n$618.02\nto slide below the 20-day EMA ($609).\nBNB/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\nBuyers will again attempt to push and maintain the price above $635. If they manage to do that, the BNB/USDT pair could rise to $667. This level may act as a hurdle, but if the bulls clear it, the pair may ascend to $722.\nContrary to this assumption, if the price turns down and breaks below the 20-day EMA, it will indicate that the bulls have given up. That may sink the pair to the 50-day SMA ($588) and then to the uptrend line.\nXRP price analysis\nXRP\nXRP\n$1.10\nturned down from $1.27 on Nov. 17 but found support near the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level of $0.97.\nXRP/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\nThe bulls purchased the dip and are again trying to push the price above $1.27. If they succeed, the XRP/USDT pair could soar to $1.40 and subsequently to $1.70.\nHowever, the recent rally has pushed the RSI deeply into the overbought territory. This suggests that the markets are overheated in the short term. That could result in a minor correction or consolidation for some time. If the price turns down from $1.27, the pair may fall to $1 and remain between these two levels for a few days. \nRelated: Why is XRP price up today?\nDogecoin price analysis\nDogecoin\nDOGE\n$0.3883\nhas been taking support just above the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level of $0.33.\nDOGE/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\nThe shallow pullback suggests the bulls expect the uptrend to continue. If buyers push the price above $0.39, the DOGE/USDT pair could jump to $0.44. This level may act as a barrier, but if the bulls overcome it, the pair could surge to $0.50 and later to $0.59.\nThis positive view will be invalidated in the near term if the price turns down and breaks below $0.32. The pair may tumble to the 20-day EMA ($0.28), which is expected to attract buyers.\nCardano price analysis\nSellers tried to stall Cardano’s\nADA\n$0.7523\nup move near $0.80 on Nov. 16, but the shallow pullback on Nov. 17 shows buying on every minor dip.\nADA/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\nThe bulls are again attempting to clear the overhead hurdle at $0.80. If they manage to do that, the ADA/USDT pair could start the next leg of the uptrend. The pair may rise to $1 and, after that, to $1.25.\nContrarily, if the price turns down from $0.80, it will signal that the bears are fiercely defending the level. Sellers will have to tug the price below $0.70 to start a deeper correction to $0.65 and then to the 20-day EMA ($0.54).\nShiba Inu price analysis\nShiba Inu\nSHIB\n$0.00002527\nhas been sustaining above the 20-day EMA ($0.000022), but the bulls are struggling to start a strong rebound.\nSHIB/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\nThe first sign of strength will be a close above $0.000026. If that happens, the SHIB/USDT pair could climb to $0.000030. Sellers will pose a strong challenge at $0.000030, but if the bulls prevail, the pair will complete a bullish inverted head-and-shoulders pattern. The pair could rally to $0.000039 and then to $0.000047.\nAlternatively, if the price turns down and breaks below the 20-day EMA, it will signal that the bulls are losing their grip. The pair may slump to the 50-day SMA ($0.000019).\nExplore more articles like this\nSubscribe to the Markets Outlook newsletter\nGet critical insights to spot investment opportunities, mitigate risks, and refine your trading strategies.
